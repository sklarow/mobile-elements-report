# AGENTS Instructions

This repository hosts a static GitHub Pages site built only with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Guidelines

- There is no build step, package manager, or test suite. Avoid running commands like `npm install` or `npm test` â€“ they will fail and waste time.
- To preview changes, open `index.html` directly in a browser or use a simple static server such as `npx http-server`.
- Keep files lightweight and self-contained. Use **two spaces** for indentation.
- Asset files live under the `assets/` directory; maintain relative paths when adding or moving files.

These instructions apply repository-wide.
